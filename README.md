Rules for my work in progress TTRPG

All the rules are work in progress and are probably going to be changed and updated somewhat frequently

>note that sections marked with ðŸ”»Red TrianglesðŸ”» mean they require additions

### General Rules:

Games typically consist of 4 "players" and 1 "storyteller", although its just a guideline what what most of the game is balanced for. With more or less players balance accordingly

#### Players:
Players are in control of one character. For that character they have a standard deck of 52 cards which will determine their fate. During social events, combat, and exploration players will have to draw from their own deck. Running out of cards in this deck signifies character exhaustion and players will have to expend resources to reshuffle their deck. Resting at a safe town allows players to reshuffle their deck for free, while also replenishing their abilities/stats/health/etc.

#### Storytellers:
Storytellers will use a variety of tarot and poker decks mixed and combined to determine events or enemy damage, social outcome, etc.
